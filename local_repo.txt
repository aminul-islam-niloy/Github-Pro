git commit -m "Valid commit message"

git log to see commit
git log --oneline to see head and short details


you can also use git add . && git commit -m "Commit message at the same time"

to reset local repository to staging and woriking area :

git reset --soft HEAD^
git reset HEAD^ for direct working stage
git reset --hard HEAD^ for hard reset and back to previous commit

deleting by position and commit id
to find commit id follow this command git log --oneline
after that clean by position:

git reset --soft HEAD~2 to reset previous two
git reset --soft HEAD~1 to reset previous one


To show all details:
git status
git log
git log --oneline 
git show
git show commit_id for specific commit
git show HEAD
git show HEAD~1


Best practics is use git chackout insted of git rstore and 
git chackout commit_id you can go back previous commmit that you want to go.

Now you can change and and you can push.
commit will be next future and if you want to go back main or head then type

git chackout master/ main/ your branch



use upsade?

no tension if you want to save previous commit you can commit in new branch that's for commit will be remain.
